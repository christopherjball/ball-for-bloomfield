                <p>
                    Bloomfield is my home of choice. I’ve lived in Davis County since 2000, raised my family here, and worked with our community to bring in
                    resources that make a real difference. I believe small towns win through partnerships — pooling our creative, technical, and financial
                    strengths.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I learned that early. At age 10 in Nichols, Iowa, I was a founding youth member of the Nichols Community Club — kids sat at the same table
                    as adults and voted. That experience cemented two ideas I carry today: everyone has gifts to share, and youth deserve a seat at the table.
