                    <h3>Strong Infrastructure</h3>
                    <p>
                        Modernize electric, water, and sewer using state & federal funding so we stop wasting money on outdated systems. We’ll sequence projects
                        to minimize disruption and stretch every dollar.

                    <h3>Downtown & Housing</h3>
                    <p>
                        Keep the square vibrant and add homes for families through city–business–Main Street partnerships. The proof is already on the square —
                        we’ll keep building on what works.

                    <h3>Efficiency & Resilience</h3>
                    <p>
                        Cut waste, strengthen the grid, and prepare for storms — preventative maintenance for the whole town. We’ll use proven tools from
                        ISU/IEDA and pursue competitive grants.

                    <p>
                        Invite the whole community — especially our youth — to help shape Bloomfield’s future. Create ways for students to participate and
                        contribute ideas that make our town better.
