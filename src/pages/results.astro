                <em>When I talk about partnerships and getting things done, I'm not making campaign promises - I'm describing my track record.</em>
            </p>

            <h2>Downtown Transformation That Worked</h2>
            <p>
                <strong>The Challenge:</strong> In the early 2000s, about one-third of buildings around the square sat empty. Around 20 people lived above storefronts
                downtown.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>The Partnership:</strong> As a board member of Bloomfield Main Street, I helped forge a partnership between Main Street and the City of Bloomfield
                to pursue stabilization funding.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>The Results:</strong> Today, nearly every building around the square houses an active business, and almost 100 people call downtown Bloomfield
                home.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>How it happened:</strong> We didn't just hope for the best. We secured millions of dollars through strategic partnerships, helped business
                owners stabilize buildings, and created quality upper-story housing that people actually want to live in.
            </p>

            <h2>Energy Savings That Add Up</h2>
            <p>
                <strong>The Program:</strong> I wrote and managed a nearly $1 million federal AmeriCorps grant that brought close to 100 service members to Bloomfield
                over three years.
            </p>
            <p><strong>The Impact:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Davis County Schools save over $20,000 annually from LED lighting upgrades in the middle and elementary schools</li>
                <li>Bloomfield residents collectively save approximately $10,000 per year in electricity costs</li>
                <li>Every house in Bloomfield was visited at least three times, with up to 10 free LED bulbs installed per home</li>
                <li>Energy audits helped families understand how to reduce their utility bills</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                <strong>The Approach:</strong> Good investments mean equipment runs more efficiently and costs less to operate. We didn't just hand out light bulbs
                - we provided energy audits and rim joist insulation that deliver lasting savings.
            </p>

            <h2>Housing Growth Through Planning</h2>
            <p><strong>The Situation:</strong> Before 2017, Bloomfield had built only a handful of new homes in the previous decade.</p>
            <p>
                <strong>The Strategy:</strong> I helped implement recommendations from a University of Iowa housing study, creating a coordinated plan rather than
                hoping development would just happen.
            </p>
            <p><strong>The Results:</strong> 10 new homes were added to Bloomfield's housing stock over the next few years.</p>
            <p>
                <strong>Why it mattered:</strong> Increasing our population and fostering business growth creates more money coming in and more people to carry the
                load. Every person that leaves town means the rest of us have to pay more.
            </p>

            <h2>Infrastructure Expertise From the Inside</h2>
            <p>
                <strong>The Experience:</strong> As Interim Director of Public Works for 18 months, I gained hands-on knowledge of the infrastructure serving every
                Bloomfield resident and business.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>What I discovered:</strong> Our electrical system loses approximately 5% of purchased power as heat through old lines and transformers -
                roughly $150,000 wasted annually based on $3 million in electricity sales.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Why it matters:</strong> Some of our utility infrastructure dates back decades and is in need of help. There are grant funds available to
                help, but you need leadership that knows how to access these resources and make sure we're getting the most bang for the buck.
            </p>

            <h2>Statewide Impact and Recognition</h2>
            <p><strong>State Appointments:</strong></p>

            <h2>Community Foundation Leadership</h2>
            <p><strong>The Need:</strong> Davis County lacked a permanent foundation to support community projects and respond to local needs.</p>
            <p>
                <strong>My Role:</strong> Founding member of the Davis County Community Foundation board of directors, helping establish the organization during
                my time with Davis County Development Corporation.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>The Impact:</strong> The Foundation now provides ongoing support for community initiatives and serves as a resource for charitable giving
                that stays local.
            </p>
